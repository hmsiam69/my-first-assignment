        <p>The flood inundation has submerged houses, wells, latrines and agricultural lands disrupting basic services
            and forcing families to seek shelter. Thousands of families are facing severe shortage of food, drinking
            water and sanitation which can result in outbreak of widespread waterborne diseases. Children are also
            highly vulnerable to snake bites and drowning in such situation.</p>

            Shelter means protection during period of crisis. The people of Bangladesh, a
            country prone to natural disasters, are familiar with the ‘Cyclone Shelter’. But
            the concept of flood shelter is relatively new.

        </p>
        <p>In those areas flood shelter may be a very effective tool for
            coping with flood. In some of the areas of the country the local people have
            already established flood shelters. This paper investigates the advantages,
            disadvantages and problems of the flood shelter and proposes measures to
            improve their usefulness.</p>
